// Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic. Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal. • Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as A dog would make a great pet. • Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common. You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!


let fav_anmals : string[] = ["Lion", "Horse", "Deer"]
for(let animals of fav_anmals){
    console.log(`A ${animals} would make a great zoo`)
}

console.log("\nThese animals are very friendly to us")
