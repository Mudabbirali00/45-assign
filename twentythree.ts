// Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:

// let car = 'subaru';

// console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")

// console.log(car == 'subaru')

// • Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.

// • Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.

//test #1
let bank:any = "Meezan"
console.log("Is Bank == 'Meezan is available'? I predict true")
console.log(bank == "Meezan")

//test #2
let car:any = "Cherade"
console.log("Is car == 'Cherade is not available in my garage' I predict false")
console.log(car == "Cherade")

//test #3
let fastFood :any= "Pizza"
console.log("Is fastFood == 'I am eating Pizza' I predict true")
console.log(fastFood == "Pizza")

//test #4
let bike:any = "cd70"
console.log("Is bike ==  'cd70 is expensive?' I predict false")
console.log(bike == "cd70")

//test #5
let restaurant:any = "kababJees"
console.log("Is restaurant == 'kabaJees is closed?' i predict true")
console.log(restaurant == "kababJees")

//test #6

let station:any = "bus"
console.log("Is station == 'will the bus arrived at 9:00 clock' i predict false")
console.log(station == "car")

//test #7
